# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page DhammaTwitter clone.

This repository is built using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX for the front-end, and Node, and Express for the back-end. I hope you enjoy playing with this code. It was a fun project to continue developping my front end skills.

Built by Robbie Prokop, using a template given by the Lighthouse Labs.
